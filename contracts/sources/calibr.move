/// calibr.move
/// 
/// Main entry point module for the Calibr protocol.
/// 
/// Responsibilities:
/// - Protocol initialization and admin capabilities
/// - Entry functions that compose market, prediction, and reputation logic
/// - Admin-only functions (pause, unpause, upgrade)
/// - Global protocol state and configuration
/// 
/// This module orchestrates calls to other modules but contains minimal logic itself.
/// All business logic lives in specialized modules (market, prediction, reputation, math).
